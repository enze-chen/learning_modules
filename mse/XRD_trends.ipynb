    "# X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra trends\n",

    "This is an interactive notebook for playing around with some experimental parameters ($a$, $\\lambda$, $T$, etc.) and observing the effect on the resulting XRD spectra. I find XRD to be a particularly beautiful subject and I couldn't find any similar visualizations online. I hope this interactive demo will help you learn the _qualitative trends_ associated with powder XRD spectra. The actual numbers (e.g. intensities) should be taken with a grain of salt, but you can sift through the code and see that everything you've learned really is enough to produce a spectra!\n",

    "## How to run this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are viewing this notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enze-chen/learning_modules/blob/master/mse/XRD_trends.ipynb), then all the software is already set up for you (hooray). If you want to run the notebook locally, make sure all the Python libraries in the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/blob/master/requirements.txt) file are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, run all the cells (`Run All` in the menu or `Shift+Enter` for every cell) and then adjust the widgets at the very end. Click `Generate Plot` each time you change a setting.\n",

    "The most important equation is **Bragg's law**, given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$n\\lambda = 2d \\sin(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the order (typically $1$), $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, $d$ is the interplanar spacing, and $\\theta$ is the Bragg angle. In creating the interactive widget, we will need to solve for $\\theta$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\lambda = 2d \\sin(\\theta) \\longrightarrow \\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2d} \\right), \\quad d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h,k,l$ are the miller indices of the diffracting plane and $a$ is the lattice constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important equation is for the **Intensity**, given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I = |F|^2 \\times P \\times m \\times L \\times A \\times T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "* $F$ is the Structure factor (we take the modulus because it can be complex).\n",
    "* $P$ is the Polarization factor.\n",
    "* $m$ is the Multiplicity factor.\n",
    "* $L$ is the Lorentz factor.\n",
    "* $A$ is the Absorption factor.\n",
    "* $T$ is the Temperature factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, size effects can be included through the **Scherrer equation**, given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{K\\lambda}{\\beta \\cos(\\theta)} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is the thickness, $K \\sim 0.9$, and $\\beta$ is the FWHM of the peak in radians.\n",

    "## Assumptions I've taken great liberties with\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the structure factor, I greatly oversimplified the construction of the atomic scattering factor and selected some numbers that more or less came from the data for iron since it has both BCC and FCC structures.\n",
    "* I also combined part of the Temperature factor into the structure factor. \n",
    "* For thermal strains, I assumed uniform strain with a positive thermal expansion coefficient.\n",
    "* I combined the Lorentz and Polarization factors, as is commonly done in the literature.\n",
    "* Like any good computationalist (jk), I threw out most constant factors. Therefore, I ignored the absorption factor since it is more or less independent of $\\theta$.\n",
    "* I used a $\\sqrt[3]{\\theta}$ term to approximate the thermal background's general shape. I don't know the actual dependence, if there is one.\n",
    "* It only models FCC, BCC, and DC structures with single-atom bases. I think it's enough to get the trends, as calculations for specific materials can be found online (e.g. at [The Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)).\n",
    "* I used a Gaussian distribution to model each peak so that I could capture crystallite size effects using the Scherrer equation. Peaks in general are not Gaussian."
