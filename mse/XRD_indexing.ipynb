    "This Jupyter notebook is meant expose MSE students *with little to no Python experience* to a programmatic way of indexing a XRD spectra. It walks through the process step-by-step, so I apologize if it appears quite long. I tried to include ample explanations for the scientific computing techniques and how they relate to math and MSE concepts they might otherwise be more familiar with. If you already know another language like MATLAB or R, you should see some similarities. At the end, your results will be shown in a table, not on a spectra like the image above.\n",

    "For pedagogical reasons, there are a few places for you to fill in your own code in order to make the notebook fully functional. These are delineated with the dashed lines as follows, and you should **only change what's inside**. You don't have to edit the text or code anywhere else. I've also included \"**TODO**\" to separate the background context from the actual instructions.\n",

    "## But why should I learn this?\n",
    "Good question! These were my motivations in creating this notebook:   \n",
    "* Computational tools are becoming **increasingly pervasive** in all sub-fields of MSE.\n",
    "    * In characterization, experimental data from high-energy physics and 4D-STEM are being generated at the rate of hundreds of GBs per second. The **bottleneck to scientific discovery** is now in processing and analyzing this data.\n",
    "* Both academia and industry are beginning to view programming as a **core competency**, even if you are \"not a programmer.\"\n",
    "* Indexing powder XRD patterns is a **routine procedure with several repetitive tasks**, making it a great candidate for programmatic solutions. Write once, run anytime.\n",
    "    * This also makes powder XRD a **great teaching example** for computationalists as well as experimentalists.\n",
    "* All the buzz around computer science can make these topics appear overwhelming and exclusive. Hopefully this notebook **lowers that barrier** by a teeny amount.\n",
    "* The choice of Python (over MATLAB, for example) is because it's **open source**, beginner-friendly, easily integrated with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and **[insanely popular](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/growth_major_languages-1-1400x1200.png)**.\n",
    "    * If this notebook gets you excited, there are plenty of great resources and courses out there for learning Python. \n",
